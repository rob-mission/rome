description: New initiatives, a revolutionary message and an ancient city

---
I'm Rob. The history and culture of Western Europe has my interest and I dream of a revival of the Christian faith in Europe. In Rome I plan to be involved in planting new Christian communities. We want to spread a revolutionary message of hope in this ancient city. Through this website you can learn more about the missionary work.
