I am Rob. I am interested in the history and culture of Western Europe and I dream of a revival of the Christian faith in Europe.

Godâ€™s desire for Europe is that His Kingdom grows in every residential district, that believers raise the banner of the Gospel in their own neighbourhood.

I am involved in this European mission in three different ways: online evangelism in Italy, pioneering in The Netherlands and equiping of churchplanters in Europe. Read more [here](https://www.robvanderdussen.com/en/about/ "About").
