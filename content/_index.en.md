description: New initiatives, a revolutionary message and an ancient city

---
I'm Rob. The history and culture of Western Europe has my interest and I dream of a revival of the Christian faith in Europe. In Perugia I serve a christian church and hope to be involved in planting a new christian community in mid-Italy. The aim is to  spread a revolutionary message of hope in this Italian district.
