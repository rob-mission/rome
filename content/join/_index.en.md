## Invest

We recognise that God is the source of all the resources we have and all the resources we need. The ministry is faith based and completely reliant on the financial support and generosity of faithful fellow-Christians.

As a faith based ministry it does not need to have all funds in place before practical steps will be taken, however, the financial budget is planned and so regular donations are encouraged by those who God has lead by the Holy Spirit to contribute to the work.

All donations will be used to finance a basic lifestyle and the ministry. It is our desire to be wise stewards of each gift given to support the movement. We view your support as a sacred trust, for we know that we are accountable to you and to God for exercising good stewardship of the funds you have entrusted to us.

## Donate
