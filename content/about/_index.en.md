Work

For the following two years I will be involved in churchplanting projects in Rome as an intern. These projects are related to the City to City Europe network. City to City Europe is a trans-denominational network of urban churches and church plants committed to fostering a movement of the gospel in the cities of Europe. Throughout my two-year internship I will not only receive leadership training but will also get to immerse myself in and experience first-hand the work of the movement in bringing the power of the gospel to every part of life in Italian cities. I will get the opportunity to be involved in homegroups, social justice ministries, evangelism on campus and the start-up of a new Christian community. The aim is to be prepared for coordinating future projects across Italy.
