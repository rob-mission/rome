From 2019-2021 I received a traineeship in churchplanting in Rome and Perugia. In this period I saw that the harvest is ready but there is a lack of well-equipped servants. There are many places in Italy marked as unreached by the Biblical Gospel. How can these places be reached, like many other places in Europe? In my opinion the biblical answer is evangelism, discipleship and equipment of the saints. And that is exactly what I am doing.

**Equipping new European pioneers**

Since March 2021 I have been part of the ICP Europe team in Rotterdam. Their mission is to train new churchplanters in Europe to start up new intercultural communities. My role is to stay in touch with the workers in Europeâ€™s frontlines in order to know the needs and the obstacles they face day to day. My work is focused on their equipment through articles, podcasts, videos, training programs and international conferences.

**Online evangelism in Italy**

Although I left Italy in Winter 2021, this beautiful country remains close to my heart. I keep writing articles on the Christian faith for the evangelism [website](https://www.sentiero-cristiano.it/ "IRS") Sentiero Cristiano (Dutch foundation IRS). Besides that, I connect with pastors all over Italy in order to learn more about their challenges and to find relevant projects for collaboration.

**Pioneering at University Campus**

From May 2021 onwards I hope to serve among international students at Erasmus University in Rotterdam. ICP has the desire to start up a pilot of so-called mission groups in which I can collaborate and practice intercultural community building. At this University I hope to connect with international students, read the Word of God with them, eat together and discuss the big questions of life. I am looking forward to seeing God moving among these students!
