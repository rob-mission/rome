In the years 2019-2021 I have received a traineeship in churchplanting in Italy (Rome and Perugia). The aim was to be prepared for coordinating new projects and to serve the local Italian Christian community.

From Spring 2021 onwards, I hope to join the mission of ICP Europe in Rotterdam (The Netherlands). ICP Europe is an international organisation which aims to support pioneers across Europe to start up new projects and to integrate cultures within the local church. 

Besides that, I write articles on the christian faith for the Italian [website](https://www.sentiero-cristiano.it/ "IRS") of the Dutch foundation IRS.
